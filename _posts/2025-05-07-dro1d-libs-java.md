## Features

- **Command Management**: Simplify the creation and execution of CLI arguments.
- **I/O Utilities**: Streamline input/output operations with easily reusable implementations.
- **Localization**: Manage, create, and use locales with ease.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be modular and easy to integrate into your projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- LocaleManager requires org.json library to read & write locale files.
- Swing GUI package uses flatlaf library (min: 3.4). Some things will definitely break without it, but components and the like should still work. It will be hit & miss, try it if you like.

### Installation

Add the JAR file as a dependency in your project. If you use LocaleManager, you will also need to add the org.json library, and if you use any of the Swing GUI stuff, you will need to add the flatlaf library.

I haven't made a release jar yet, but you can clone the repository and build it from source. To build successfully, you will need the pre-requisites mentioned above, and a Java 21+ JDK.

## Usage

Please refer to the [javadocs](https://everdro1d.github.io/dro1d-libs-java/) for detailed documentation on each class and its methods.

### Example: Command Management
```java
CommandManager commandManager = new CommandManager();
commandManager.registerCommand("example", new ExampleCommand());
commandManager.executeCommand("example");
```

### Example: Localization
```java
LocaleManager localeManager = new LocaleManager(Main.class, "dro1dDev");
localeManager.loadLocaleFromFile("eng");
String message = localeManager.getVariableInComponent("MainWindow", "greetingLabel", "messageText");
System.out.println(message);
```
