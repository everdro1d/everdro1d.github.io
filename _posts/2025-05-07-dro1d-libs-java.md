## Features

- **Command Management**: Simplify the creation and execution of CLI arguments.
- **I/O Utilities**: Streamline input/output operations with easily reusable implementations.
- **Localization**: Manage, create, and use locales with ease.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be modular and easy to integrate into your projects.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Java 21+
- org.json:json:20240303
  - LocaleManager requires it to read and write locale files.
- com.formdev:flatlaf:3.4
  - Some Swing GUI things will definitely break without it, but general things
    like smaller components or util methods should still work. Others will be
    hit-and-miss, try it if you like.

#### Test Dependencies:
- org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.12.1

### Installation

Add the JAR file as a dependency in your project. If you use LocaleManager,
you will also need to add the org.json library, and if you use the Swing GUI stuff,
you should consider adding the flatlaf library to be safe.

I haven't made a release jar because of how frequently I update this library,
but you can clone the repository and build it from source. To build successfully,
you will need the pre-requisites mentioned above, and a Java 21+ JDK.
I've compiled a build chain in intellij that should work well,
run `W7: Create Artifacts` for Windows (*powershell*),
and `7: Create Artifacts` for Unix-based systems (MacOS and Linux).

**Please note:** when generating Javadocs, there should be 176 warnings.
These are due to (private) locale fields not having comments.
If this number changes, please check your Javadoc comments,
*90% of the time the warning (or error) will be at the start of the output.*

## Usage

Please refer to the [Javadocs](https://everdro1d.github.io/dro1d-libs-java/) for detailed documentation on each class and its methods.

### Example: Command Management
```java
CommandManager commandManager = new CommandManager();
commandManager.registerCommand(
        "example", new ExampleCommand()
);
  commandManager.executeCommand("example");
```

### Example: Localization
```java
LocaleManager localeManager = new LocaleManager(
  Main.class, "dro1dDev"
);
localeManager.loadLocaleFromFile("eng");
String message = localeManager.getVariableInComponent(
  "MainWindow", "greetingLabel", "messageText"
);
System.out.println(message);
```
